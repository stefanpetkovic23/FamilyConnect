# Full-Stack Native Android Project

## Overview

This project is a full-stack native Android application that integrates a robust backend service with a rich and responsive user interface. The application is designed to deliver a seamless experience for users by leveraging modern technologies in both mobile and backend development.

## Technologies Used

### Backend

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used to build scalable network applications.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Implemented for secure user authentication and session management.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing and managing application data.
- **Firebase**: Used for real-time database features and cloud storage.

### Android

- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language used for Android development, offering modern syntax and features.
- **Retrofit**: A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java, used for making network requests to the backend API.
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: An architectural pattern followed for separation of concerns and easier unit testing.
- **Design Patterns**: Various design patterns were employed to enhance code maintainability and scalability.
- **XML**: Used for designing the user interface components in the Android application.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JWT.
- **Data Management**: Seamless integration with MongoDB and Firebase for real-time data synchronization and storage.
- **Responsive UI**: A user interface that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, providing a consistent user experience.
- **RESTful API**: A robust backend service offering CRUD operations and other business logic through RESTful endpoints.
